Pandabin
========

Inspired by ompldr and `pb <https://github.com/ptpb/pb>`_, Pandabin is a FLOSS pastebin written in C.

*Note*: pandabin is still under heavy development and subject to significant API breakage with new work.
While you are welcome to host an instance as soon as you feel comfortable doing so, remember that updating to the latest version might require a full wipe of the paste database and backing files.
